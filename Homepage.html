		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi!<p>
		<p>Don't steal this.</p>
		<p>I've got only 1 picture in this version of the site, so I'll be pretty disappointed if I somehow see it on the internet outside of my Instagram.</p>

		<h2>About This Website</h2>
	<p>This website was made as a refresher to basic web development. I don't do a lot of coding on a regular basis, so I thought it would be nice to relearn HTML and make a website where I can post pictures that I take.<p>
	<p>I've removed all of my pictures with the exception of a cat, so you can see how the slideshow works. You can imagine what the rest of the images are, right?</p>
	<p>Link to Instagram's home page: (because I won't put my actual Instagram on a Github demo)</p>
